  "description": "Our mission at The App Club - Founder's Note",
  "body": "Back in November 2016, we founded The App Club at University of Malaya. We focus on a super small group of students, to focus students upwards, to **try.** That's where they will realize \"I'm not as bad as I thought\" OR \"everyone else isn’t as good as I assumed\". Then try again, and again, and again.\n\nWe need a push. App Club is the push. So, what drives us to care about this?\n\nThe fact that the **difference** between an inspirational student and a cautious one is often not their knowledge or expertise, but rather their confidence. Example: A cautious student may say: \"I'm NOT joining that competition because I'm not good enough\", while an inspirational student will say: \"I AM joining that competition because I'm not good enough!\" referring to the exact same competition. **It's not what we are but we're going to be that matters**, and if one day we can successfully transfer only this one simple message to the community, we'd say \"We succeeded\".\n\n— originally published as [Founder's note](https://www.facebook.com/notes/the-um-app-club/our-mission-at-the-app-club/1868139433426220/) on our Facebook page."
